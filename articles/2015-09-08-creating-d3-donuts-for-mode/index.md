# Creating D3 Donuts for Mode

## D3, ever heard of it?

### What is it?
D3 is a JavaScript Library that combines powerful visualization components with a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation. As a library it is extremely flexible, working directly with HTML, CSS and SVG to display data in any way you can imagine. It is also fun to write thanks to it's functional style that allows for method chaining, and code reusability.
