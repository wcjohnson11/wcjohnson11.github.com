# What is data science?

Data science is a tool for finding meaning, or predicting behavior in complex systems by using math and large quantities of data.
A good data scientist requires at least three domains of knowledge; hacking and technical skill to process the data, mathematical skill to drive the technical processes and substantive expertise, which helps in knowing which questions to ask, interpreting the data well and understanding it's structure.
However, data scientists often work in teams so it certain members can specialize in certain domains.

### What real world problems can be solved with data science?

Those you'd expect (traditional tech problems that improve our online experience) 
Recommendation engines - Netflix, Social Media 
Web apps - OKCupid, Uber, etc. finding trends in how people use technology
Those you might not expect (wider-ranging problems that affect 
-Bioinformatics -Urban Planning -Astrophysics -Public Health -Natural Language -Sports

### What makes a good data scientist

Someone with a curious mind. A good data scientist needs to be able to ask the right questions and see what is good data and what isn't. This isn't something that happens immediately, it takes practice. The substantive expertise helps frame and develop the right questions and also recognize valuable data.
Knowing which algorithm to use is also very valuable in addition to creating mathematical models to make predictions based on some data attributes and technical skill is necessary to get all of this done quickly.

### What tools do they use?

Pandas! Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible and expressive data structures designed to work with relational and labeled data both easy and intuitive. It is a high=level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.

### Where does the data come from?

Luckily, these days there is no shortage of places to get data. 
[Open Government](https://www.data.gov/open-gov/) is one of my favorites, containing a diverse array of city-level and international-level data sets.
In addition to Open Gov, many popular tech companies have open APIs that you can get large quantities of data from.
A great resource that I will be using in a future blog post is [Kaggle's Titanic Dataset](http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted) where I will use basic Data Science to predict passenger's chances of survival
